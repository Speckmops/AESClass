# AESClass
AESClass is a lightweight class for encrypting and decrypting with AES.

You can encrypt or decrypt byte[], base64-strings or normal strings to your favorite output type. 


## Facts

- .NET native AES-Implementation
- Hardcoded Keysize 256 / Blocksize 128
- PBKDF2 Padding with random iteration (adjustable)
- Random IV *(on every encryption)*


## EncryptedPaket-Structure

| Offset | Length | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | 4 bytes | Int32 | PBKDF2-Iterations |
| `0x04` | 16 bytes | byte[] | Initial vector *(autogenerated)* |
| `0x14` | 64 bytes | byte[] | Salt *(autogenerated)* |
| `0x54` | n bytes | byte[] | Encrypted data |
